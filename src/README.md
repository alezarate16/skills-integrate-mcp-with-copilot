# Mergington High School Activities API

A super simple FastAPI application that allows students to view and sign up for extracurricular activities.

## Features

- View all available extracurricular activities
- Sign up for activities
- Persist activities and participants in SQLite storage

## Getting Started

1. Install the dependencies:

   ```
   pip install fastapi uvicorn
   ```

2. Initialize the database:

   ```
   python -c "from app import init_db; init_db()"
   ```

   This creates `activities.db` in `src/` and seeds it with the default activities the first time it runs.

3. Run the application:

   ```
   uvicorn app:app --reload
   ```

4. Open your browser and go to:

| POST   | `/activities/{activity_name}/signup?email=student@mergington.edu` | Sign up for an activity                                             |
| DELETE | `/activities/{activity_name}/unregister?email=student@mergington.edu` | Remove a student from an activity                               |

## Data Model

The application uses a simple data model with meaningful identifiers:

1. **Activities** - Uses activity name as identifier:

   - Description
   - Schedule
   - Maximum number of participants allowed
   - List of student emails who are signed up

2. **Students** - Uses email as identifier:
   - Name
   - Grade level

All data is stored in SQLite, so activities and registrations remain available after the server restarts.
